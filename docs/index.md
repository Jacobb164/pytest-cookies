# Welcome to pytest-cookies

[pytest] is a mature full-featured Python testing tool that provides easy
no boilerplate testing. Its hook-based customization system supports integration
of external plugins such as **pytest-cookies**.

This plugin comes with a ``cookies`` fixture which is a wrapper for the
[cookiecutter] API for generating projects. It helps you verify that your
template is working as expected and takes care of cleaning up after running the
tests.
